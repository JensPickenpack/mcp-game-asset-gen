# AGENTS.md

This file contains instructions for future agents working on this MCP server project.

## Design Philosophy: Fall into the Pit of Success

This MCP server is designed as a development tool that should make users "fall into the pit of success." This means:

- **Sensible Defaults**: All tools should work well with minimal configuration
- **Automatic Optimization**: The server should automatically choose the best parameters for quality
- **Consistency by Default**: Reference images for 3D generation must maintain object consistency across views
- **Error Prevention**: Design APIs that prevent common mistakes (like generating different objects for different views)
- **Quality First**: Prioritize output quality over exposing every parameter option

When adding new features, always ask: "Will this help users succeed without needing to understand the underlying complexity?"

## Development Workflow

### Testing

- Run unit tests with `npm test` (uses `vitest run` for non-watch mode, mocked providers)
- Run integration tests with `npm run test:integration` (calls real APIs, requires API keys, keeps generated images)
- Run integration tests with cleanup: `npm run test:integration:cleanup` (calls real APIs and deletes test images)
- Run all tests with `npm run test:all`
- Tests are located in `src/` with `*.test.ts` extension
- Integration tests are in `src/integration.test.ts`
- Generated test images are saved to `test_assets/` (gitignored)
- All new functionality should include comprehensive tests
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, file system operations) in unit tests
- Integration tests use real providers when `NO_MOCK_PROVIDERS` environment variable is set
- Set `CLEANUP_TEST_FILES=true` to delete generated test images after integration tests

### Type Checking

- Always run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- TypeScript configuration is in `tsconfig.json`
- Strict mode is enabled

### Building

- Build with `npm run build` (compiles to `dist/`)
- Development mode: `npm run dev` (builds and starts)
- Production: `npm run start` (runs from `dist/`)

### Linting

- Run `npm run lint` to check code style
- ESLint configuration for TypeScript

```

## Adding New Tools

1. Implement provider functions in `src/providers/`
2. Add tool schema to `ListToolsRequestSchema` in `src/index.ts`
3. Add tool handler in `CallToolRequestSchema` in `src/index.ts`
4. Import the new functions at the top of `src/index.ts`
5. Write comprehensive tests in `src/*.test.ts`
6. Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before committing

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

- `PPQ_API_KEY` - PPQ.ai API key for image, video and audio generation
- `FAL_AI_API_KEY` - FAL.ai API key for 3D model generation

Optional environment variables:

- `ALLOWED_TOOLS` - Comma-separated list of tools to make available (default: all tools)
- `CLEANUP_TEST_FILES` - Set to 'true' to delete test images after integration tests (default: false)

## MCP Server Architecture

- Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- Supports tools and prompts
- Error handling returns structured responses
- All tools return JSON strings with metadata
- Tool filtering via `ALLOWED_TOOLS` environment variable for reduced context usage

## 3D Model Generation

### Supported Models

- **Trellis** (FAL.ai): Single and multi-image variants
- **Hunyuan3D 2.0** (FAL.ai): Single, multi, single-turbo, and multi-turbo variants

### Features

- **Automatic Reference Generation**: When only a text prompt is provided, automatically generates reference images using PPQ.ai (prefer image-to-image models such as `flux-kontext-pro` or `flux-2-pro-i2i` for subsequent views to preserve consistency)
- **Base64 URI Support**: Default input format for images
- **Smart Variant Selection**: Automatically chooses single vs multi based on input image count
- **GLB/GLTF Output**: Web and game engine compatible 3D formats

### Implementation Details

- Core functions in `src/utils/model3dUtils.ts`
- Helper functions with automatic reference generation in `src/providers/model3dHelpers.ts`
- Tool schemas and handlers in `src/index.ts`
- Comprehensive tests in `src/model3dHelpers.test.ts`

### Reference Image Consistency (Critical for 3D Quality)

**Problem**: Generating different objects for different views creates unusable 3D models.

**Solution**: The `generateReferenceImages()` function ensures consistency by:

1. **First View**: Generated from text prompt (usually front view)
2. **Subsequent Views**: Use previous image(s) as input with modified prompts
3. **View Ordering**: Always generates front view first for consistency
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Uses "Create a [view] view of the same object, maintaining exact consistency"

**Implementation Requirements**:

- Never generate multiple views independently from text prompts
- Always use image-to-image generation for subsequent views
- Maintain sharp, high-quality prompts with specific camera models
- Include "sharp edges, fine details" and "Sony A7R IV" for quality
- This ensures users "fall into the pit of success" with consistent 3D generation

## Testing Guidelines

- Mock external dependencies (API calls, file system operations) in unit tests
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Test environment variable validation
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocking
- Test tool schema validation indirectly through function calls
- Test `ALLOWED_TOOLS` filtering functionality in unit tests

## Commit Process

1. Make changes
2. Run `npm run typecheck`
3. Run `npm test`
4. Run `npm run lint`
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Build should pass automatically
